    "### I. Brute-force\n",
    "Brute Force algorithm is a straightforward algorithmic approach that systematically explores all possible solutions to a problem until the correct one is found. It is often used when the problem space is small or when no optimized solution is available. This method is simple to implement but can be computationally expensive for larger problems due to its exhaustive nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Characteristics\n",
    "Brute Force Search involves methodically testing every possible solution in a specified order. It does not use optimization techniques or heuristics, relying solely on exhaustive exploration. This makes it a generic approach applicable to various domains, such as string matching, combinatorial problems, and cybersecurity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in string search, the algorithm compares a substring against every possible position in the target string until a match is found. Similarly, in combinatorial problems, it tests all combinations of elements to find the desired result.\n"

    "### II. Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm is an efficient string-searching method that finds all occurrences of a \"pattern\" within a \"text\" by avoiding unnecessary re-examinations of characters. Developed by Donald Knuth, Vaughan Pratt, and James H. Morris, KMP improves search speed by using information gathered during the pattern preprocessing phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "KMP preprocesses the pattern to build an auxiliary array called the Longest Prefix Suffix (LPS) array. The LPS array indicates the longest proper prefix of the pattern that is also a suffix for each sub-pattern. This allows the algorithm to skip certain comparisons when a mismatch occurs, leading to improved performance over naive approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Preprocessing the Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The LPS array is constructed for the pattern before the search begins. For each position in the pattern, it stores the length of the longest prefix that matches a suffix ending at that position. This preprocessing step enables the KMP algorithm to efficiently determine how far to shift the pattern after a mismatch, minimizing redundant comparisons during the search phase."

This is largely due to early matches in the text and the preprocessing overhead in KMP and Boyer-Moore. However, in harder scenarios—such as long patterns near the end or not present at all—the advanced algorithms clearly outperformed brute-force.\n",
